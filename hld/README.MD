### HLD_1.txt : Notofication system design : 
---
#####  Design a notification system, any service can use this notification system to target the user </br> 1. Service can sent 10M push notification ,5M SMS notification and 2M email notification on daily </br> 2. Notification Service should also handle notification in batches </br> 3. Assume Service which uses notification , can sent 10K notification in batches

* Backof the envelope calculation

    * calculating the size of the user_profile table

        column name   |data type
        ------------- | -------------

    * Assuming each user have 1 device , currently notification system have <b>50M</b> user  only  

      * user table

        * Assuming  record will take 1KB of data , 50M*1KB ~- 50GB
      * similary for device table and ither table we can consider 0.25KB of data i.e 25GB of data 

      * Sice we know every day we are sending the 10 milion push notification, 5 miniloin SMS and 2 milion email notofication

         * push_notification : 

            * TPS (Transaction per second) : 10M daily => 10M/ (24*60*60) => 1200 TPS 

            * Storage : 
              total size of message is : 500 byte => so 10M*500 => 5GB data every day

              for 5 year's => 5*365 ~=2TB*5 ~= 10TB of storage for push nottification

          * Similary we cancalculate for email and SMS notification

      * Assume in peeak , which last for 10 minute and we need to send 10M/minute push notification <b>Then how we calculate partition , required worker node and network bandwidth</b>

        * total messge in 10 minute : 10*10M => 100M message </br> per sec messge => 10M/(60) ~= <b>167k message per sec</b></br> 
        
        * Assuming one partition handle 50k/sec , then 167k/50k ~= <b>4 partition </b>
        * Assuming one worker node are processing 1000/sec , then total worker node required is ~167
        * Calculate network bandwidth

          * for email notification<br>

             * Assume each mail is 10KB of size , and we are sending 2M message every day (from problem statement given above) , <b>~=24 message/sec</b>

               * Total message size per sec = <b>24*10 => 240KB message/sec</b></br>
             
             * Assume in peek time we sent 10M/sec , then how we will calculate network bandwidth



### News feed system (HLD2)

```
1. User can post
2. poste can be viwed by frends of the user

API :
  POST /user/post
  GET /post/{postId}
  

Assumption :
	1. Each user can have 5k freinds
	2. The user who is logedin can view the notification about the post
	3. User who is not logedin and active can view the post one user loggedin
	4. User can do three post/day 
	5. system have 500M user and daily active user 10% and 2% user use media along the text post
	6. Text size is 500 byte
	7. media size (image or video) is 1 MB


Calculate TPS :
	Since we know we 10% user are active at given point of time i.e 50M user are active
	Since each user can do 3 post per day, so total post in one day is 50*3 : 150M 
	TPS = (150/86400) ~= 1800 TPS

Storage : 500 byte*50M ~= 25000M byte ~= 25*10^9 ~=25GB 
Media storage ~= 50*0.02*3 => 3M => 3*10^6*10^6 => 3*10^12 => 3TB of media storage every day

Since text store is very negligible as compared to media storage , so every day we will be storing 3TB data
for one month 30*3 => 90TB, for year => 90*12 => 108TB , for 5 year => 540 TB

Network bandwidth : Since TPS is 1800 and each message size 500 byte => 900000 => 900KB ~= 1MB/sec 


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SQL DB schema :
User DB
	userId,userName,isActive
post DB
	UserId,postId,postText,media,time

---

1. User friend , we can store in GraphDB to find relationship b/w user and their friends
2. We will be using cache to store the userId,postId,datatime
3. We will notify the user freinds
