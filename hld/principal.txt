1. There are some basic principal which we need to ask/consider/assume while desigining the HLD 

1. Is this application will use from mobile and web both ?
2. how may user will be using this system ? , can we consider user will scale at 10% every month
3. how many daily active user we can consider 

We can ask from above three question to drive the discussion





10 Key principal for system design
1. Communicate efficiently
2. Defined the scope of the problem with interviewer (Mean the scope should be minimum and get aggrement with interviwer) , this has to be done within 5 minute
3. drawing the box and component involved in system design
4. start with simple solution , i.e working solution which fullfill our requirement, do not try to optimise the component or solution. Do not add any extra feature 
    which never asked by interviwer
